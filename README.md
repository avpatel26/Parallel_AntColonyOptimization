# Traveling Salesman Problem using Ant colony optimization with MPI

Travelling salesman problem is one of the best-researched algorithms in the stream of computer science. TSP problem is the NP-hard problem and different algorithms are used to solve that problem. Ant colony optimization is one of them, this algorithm uses the action of ants to find the shortest path for food using pheromone.
